# GhostRacer

## Introduction

Ghost Racer is a post-apocalyptic 2D driving/shooting game. Our hero drives the Ghost Racer north on the 405 freeway. Zombies roam around, and some are even driving taxi cabs. The few humans that are left wander aimlessly, and the souls of the recently deceased have convened on the 405 freeway, waiting for someone to free them.

## Gameplay

The player controls the Ghost Racer.

In order to pass a certain level, the player needs to free the required number of trapped souls.

While doing so, the player has to dodge wandering human pedestrians (hitting a human ped instantly ends the level), shoot zombies with holy water, run zombie cabs off the road, and avoid dangerous oil slicks (which cause the Ghost Racer to slip and slide).

The player can also pick up goodies like healing kits and holy water recharges that randomly spawns on the road. Once all of the souls in the current level has been saved, the player can advance to the next level.

## How to Win Points

Points are awarded as follows:

- When Ghost Racer disposes of a zombie pedestrian: 150 points
- When Ghost Racer disposes of a zombie cab: 200 points
- When Ghost Racer saves a soul: 100 points
- When Ghost Racer picks up a holy water refill goodie: 50 points
